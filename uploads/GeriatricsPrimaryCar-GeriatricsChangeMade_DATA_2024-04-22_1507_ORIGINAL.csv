I feel more confident in my decision to not prescribe certain medications or have that conversation with patients and caregivers about whey certain medications are not safe. Additionally, knowing that there are certain tools we can use to get a better idea of life expectancy is helpful in guiding treatment and referrals to certain specialists. It makes me feel overall more comfortable with some of these decisions. "
